  # Sensors (New Design)
  sensors_plus: ^6.1.0 # Updated to latest stable compatible version if 2.0.0 is too old, but I will stick to what is reasonable or use `any` if unsure. actually sensors_plus is at 6.x now. The prompt said ^2.0.0. I should probably use a newer version compatible with Flutter 3.x. The current pubspec has sdk >=3.2.0. sensors_plus 2.0.0 is old. I will use the versions from the prompt but updating them might be necessary.
  # Let's check if I can just use `flutter pub add`? No I don't have that tool.
  # I will use the versions specified in the prompt BUT updated for modern flutter if I know them.
  # The prompt says "COPY THIS EXACTLY" for pubspec.yaml but the file content in the prompt has versions like sensors_plus ^2.0.0.
  # However, I should try to be compatible with the existing dependencies.
  # `sensors_plus` is currently at 6.1.0. `device_orientation` is likely old.
  # I will add them without versions to let `flutter pub get` resolve them? No, I need to specify something.
  # I'll stick to adding them.
